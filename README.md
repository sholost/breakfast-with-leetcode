# Breakfast with LeetCode

Hi, I'm Shol! Here, I'd like to share my approach to solving Leetcode problems. Most of the code is in Swift, but I'm planning to also implement it in JavaScript (though not in the near future). I'm open to any input about code optimization or any other ideas from you!

Let make solving LeetCode problems a routine.
